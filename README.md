# dot-install
Install Dot Files -- Change Configuration based on Local Settings and Installed Packages

We are trying to enforce as consistent of a development space as possible.

## Instructions

### `dot-install.sh` 

Display available options

### `dot-install.sh install` 

Run the installer. This will perform system checks and modify the installation process according to the availability of the configuration's dependencies. If the installer has already been run, this will update the files as necessary.

### `dot-install.sh check`

Check system dependencies, and display the status of required installed programs (e.g. git, python, php, etc.) and system variables
